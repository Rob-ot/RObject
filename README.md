# ToDo

a nice api for grouping events, like .pauseEvents() and later resume to fire the least amount of events needed to get up to date.

A Date library that fires change events when time changes and stuff (simply wrap Moment)


_.span

fromObject

2d arrays?

groupMap, just like map except gives arrays when new things are added in chunks, like for mapping favorites to add info by doing an xhr for each item )each group of items as they are added
